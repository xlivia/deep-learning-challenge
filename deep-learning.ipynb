Overview\n","The purpose of this analysis is to develop a neural network model using deep learning techniques to predict the success of Alphabet Soup-funded organizations. The dataset used for this analysis is the \"charity_data.csv\" file, which contains various features related to the organizations.\n","\n","## Results\n","\n","### Data Preprocessing\n","1. What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?\n","  - The target variable for our model is \"IS_SUCCESSFUL\", which indicates the success of Alphabet Soup-funded organizations.\n","2. What variable(s) are the feature(s) for your model?\n","  - The features for our model include all columns except \"IS_SUCCESSFUL\", \"EIN\", and \"NAME\".\n","3. What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?\n","  - The variables \"EIN\" and \"NAME\" were removed from the input data as they are neither targets nor features.\n","\n","### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model\n","4. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?\n","  - For the initial model, we selected two hidden layers with 64 and 32 neurons, respectively. The activation function used was ReLU, which helps introduce non-linearity to the model. The output layer had a single neuron with the sigmoid activation function to predict the binary outcome.\n","  - For the optimized model, we increased the complexity by adding an additional hidden layer with 128 neurons. This allows the model to capture more complex patterns in the data.\n","5. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?\n","  - The target model performance was not explicitly defined in the requirements. However, the model achieved a reasonably high accuracy that exceeded 75%.\n","6. What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?\n","  - We experimented with different model architectures, adding more layers and neurons to increase the model's capacity.\n","  - We adjusted the preprocessing steps, including the binning of rare categorical variables, to optimize the data representation.\n","  - We trained the model for a higher number of epochs to allow more opportunities for learning.\n","\n","## Summary\n","The initial neural network model achieved a satisfactory accuracy on the test data. The optimized model showed further improvement in accuracy, indicating that the additional layers and neurons contributed to enhanced performance.\n","\n","### Recommendation: Using a Different Model\n","To solve the same classification problem, we could consider using a gradient boosting algorithm such as XGBoost or LightGBM. These models have demonstrated success in handling structured data and have the ability to capture complex interactions between features. The decision tree-based nature of these models allows them to handle a mix of categorical and numerical features without requiring extensive preprocessing steps.\n","\n","Using a gradient boosting model could provide advantages such as better interpretability, as feature importance can be easily extracted. Additionally, these models can handle imbalanced datasets effectively, which is often the case in classification tasks.\n","\n","However, the choice of model ultimately depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the trade-offs between interpretability and predictive performance. Further experimentation and comparative analysis would be necessary to determine the best model for this problem."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0HmaNTfn8Fkr"},"source":["# Download the saved model files"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":22,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":17},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":124,"status":"ok","timestamp":1689012667813,"user":{"displayName":"Olivia Bryant","userId":"08301163434010297364"},"user_tz":240},"id":"OxvoSkSZ7_VC","outputId":"b4a34626-736b-4e00-9e6c-f18e1e1800df"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/javascript":"\n    async function download(id, filename, size) {\n      if (!google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed) {\n        return;\n      }\n      const div = document.createElement('div');\n      const label = document.createElement('label');\n      label.textContent = `Downloading \"${filename}\": `;\n      div.appendChild(label);\n      const progress = document.createElement('progress');\n      progress.max = size;\n      div.appendChild(progress);\n      document.body.appendChild(div);\n\n      const buffers = [];\n      let downloaded = 0;\n\n      const channel = await google.colab.kernel.comms.open(id);\n      // Send a message to notify the kernel that we're ready.\n      channel.send({})\n\n      for await (const message of channel.messages) {\n        // Send a message to notify the kernel that we're ready.\n        channel.send({})\n        if (message.buffers) {\n          for (const buffer of message.buffers) {\n            buffers.push(buffer);\n            downloaded += buffer.byteLength;\n            progress.value = downloaded;\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      const blob = new Blob(buffers, {type: 'application/binary'});\n      const a = document.createElement('a');\n      a.href = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n      a.download = filename;\n      div.appendChild(a);\n      a.click();\n      div.remove();\n    }\n  ","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/javascript":"download(\"download_b8f9b93f-5b85-47ef-96a7-1c7a47540df2\", \"AlphabetSoupCharity.h5\", 112184)","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/javascript":"\n    async function download(id, filename, size) {\n      if (!google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed) {\n        return;\n      }\n      const div = document.createElement('div');\n      const label = document.createElement('label');\n      label.textContent = `Downloading \"${filename}\": `;\n      div.appendChild(label);\n      const progress = document.createElement('progress');\n      progress.max = size;\n      div.appendChild(progress);\n      document.body.appendChild(div);\n\n      const buffers = [];\n      let downloaded = 0;\n\n      const channel = await google.colab.kernel.comms.open(id);\n      // Send a message to notify the kernel that we're ready.\n      channel.send({})\n\n      for await (const message of channel.messages) {\n        // Send a message to notify the kernel that we're ready.\n        channel.send({})\n        if (message.buffers) {\n          for (const buffer of message.buffers) {\n            buffers.push(buffer);\n            downloaded += buffer.byteLength;\n            progress.value = downloaded;\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      const blob = new Blob(buffers, {type: 'application/binary'});\n      const a = document.createElement('a');\n      a.href = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n      a.download = filename;\n      div.appendChild(a);\n      a.click();\n      div.remove();\n    }\n  ","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/javascript":"download(\"download_57082d0e-7864-4768-8696-8dadda06f166\", \"AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5\", 274440)","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["from google.colab import files\n","files.download(\"models/AlphabetSoupCharity.h5\")\n","files.download(\"models/AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5\")"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyMLOccSzmfMzmiP8yhtXiMu","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
